Release Notes for Trilinos Package Stratimikos
----------------------------------------------


Trilinos 14.0

* Support for "Ifpack2" preconditioner factory officially added to the
  Stratimikos::LinearSolverBuilder class when Ifapck2 support is enabled in
  the Stratimikos package.  Therefore, any client code that was adding support
  for the "Ifpack2" preconditioner to the Stratimikos::LinearSolverBuilder
  object using a call to setPreconditioningStrategyFactory() will now result
  in an exception being thrown.  The fix is to just remove the now redundant
  call to setPreconditioningStrategyFactory().


Trilinos 10.0:
--------------

* Support for newer Belos solvers have not be added yet
